# Introduction

Iâ€™m Dr Jonathan Salo,  a GI Cancer Surgeon at the Levine Cancer Institute in Charlotte, North Carolina.

If you're viewing this video, chances are that you or someone close to you has encountered esophageal cancer and is contemplating treatment.

---

For a refresher, esophageal cancer, as it grows, can tends to make it difficult for patients to swallow.

So patients with esophageal cancer fit into two main groups:

- A small group who don't have any difficulty eating that have *early* stage disease
- Majority of patients who have some difficulty eating or may have weight loss who have *advanced* disease.

---

Among those with early stage disease, there are two categories: 

- Superficial -> Treated without surgery
- Localized -> Treated with surgery alone

For more information about early stage esophageal cancer, there is a link above and in the description. [Non-obstructing esophageal tumors](06-Eso_Early.html)

---

This video will focus on *advanced* esophageal cancer, which consists of two categories: Locally Advanced and Metastatic.

- Locally Advanced -> T3M0
- Metastatic -> M1

---


If this terminology is not familiar to you, please refer to our video on Esophageal Cancer Diagnosis and Staging. There is a link above and in the description below.

[Esophageal Cancer Diagnosis and Staging](02_Eso_Dx_Staging.html)

---

Locally-advanced tumors are usually T3, meaning that the tumor has grow through the wall of the esophagus *AND* there is *no* signs of spread to other organs, so they are M0

```
---

Metastatic esophageal cancer is a case where there has been spread to other organs such as the liver or lungs.  These are considered stage M1.


---

To review: advanced esophageal cancer usually is accompanied by difficulty eating, and consists of two caregories:

Locally Advanced cancers are T3 and M0 and usually Stage III

Metastatic cancers are M1 and considered Stage IV


---


# Treatment

For patients with Locally Advanced tumors that are T3 and M0, the usual treatment is a combination of chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery called trimodality therapy.  There is a link here for a video that discussed the treatment of Locally Advanced tumors.


---

For patients with Metastatic tumors that are M1, the usual treatment is chemotherapy.  In most cases, this is given intravenously through a central venous port.  Chemotherapy is administered under the care of a Medical Oncologist.

---

In either case, locally advanced or metastatic, chemotherapy is used as a part of the initial treatment. Chemotherapy is administered under the direction of a *Medical Oncologist*

---

For many patients with advanced cancers, nutrition is a challenge because the tumor can make it difficult to eat. You may find a consultation with a *Dietitian* to be helpful. Some patients with advanced esophageal cancer will need a *feeding tube* to help support their nutrition during their cancer treatment. 

---

Once the staging studies are complete, you and your esophageal cancer treatment team can design a treatment plan for you and your cancer.

At the end of this video there will be links to additional videos which address locally-advanced esophageal cancer and metastatic esophageal cancer. This way, if you already know the results of the staging studies, you can view specific information.

---

I hope you have found this video helpful. This videos and others like it are designed to educate patients and families about esophageal cancer and equip them for their discussions with their esophageal cancer care team. 

As always, these videos are no substitute for expert medical advice.
