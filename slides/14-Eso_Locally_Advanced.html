# Introduction

I’m Dr Jonathan Salo,  a GI Cancer Surgeon in Charlotte, North Carolina.

If you're viewing this video, chances are that you or someone close to you has encountered esophageal cancer and is contemplating treatment.

---

This video focuses on patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer. This is defined as T3 or Node-positive esophageal cancer.  

If that terminology is unfamiliar or you haven't seen our video on Esophageal Cancer Treatment Options video, a link is provided in the description.


---

For a refresher, we have four major categories of esophageal cancers:

- Superficial -&gt; Treated without surgery
- Localized -&gt; Treated with surgery alone
- Locally Advanced -&gt; Chemotherapy + Radiation -&gt; Surgery
- Metastatic -&gt; Chemotherapy

---

We're going to focus on two categories: localized and locally advanced

---

This drawing shows a localized tumor. These tumors are T2 and have negative lymph nodes. These tend to be smaller tumors that are less likely to spread to lymph nodes.  In general, because T2 tumors are smaller, they generally don't cause difficulty with eating or weight loss.

---

This shows a locally-advanced tumors which are either T3 or has signs of spread to lymph nodes. T3 tumors are more likely to spread to lymph nodes than T2 tumors. T3 Tumors are more likely to cause trouble eating or weight loss.  Signs of spread to lymph nodes is generally seen on CT scan or PET scan. In these cases, it is referred to as a "node-positive" cancer.

---

Esophagectomy surgery removes the tumor and the surrounding lymph nodes.  In some cases, however, there is a risk of microscopic disease that can't be seen and can't be removed by surgery alone.

---

For patients with esophageal cancer that is either T3 or Node-positive, research has shown that *initial* treatment with chemotherapy and radiation therapy makes the surgery more effective by killing microscopic tumor cells that can't be detected at the time of surgery. 

Research has shown that a combination of chemotherapy plus radiation, followed by surgery, is the more effective than surgery alone for T3 or node-positive tumors.

# Trimodality Therapy

Over 10 years ago, researchers in the Netherlands took a group of 363 patients with esophageal cancer and divided them into two groups. They they treated the two groups with two different treatment strategies.

The first group was treated with surgery alone.

The second group was treated with chemotherapy and radiation together for six weeks, followed by surgery.

---

The results were quite dramatic: The group that was treated with all three therapies, chemotherapy and radiation and surgery, lived on average twice a long as patients who had surgery alone.

---

This scientific study was called the CROSS trial.  The therapy called tri-modality therapy, because three therapies are administered: chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery.

---

A typical schedule for trimodality therapy is six weeks of chemotherapy and radiation together.  Chemotherapy is given once a week, and radiation five days per week.

---

Several weeks after the end of radiation therapy, a PET or CT scan is done to look at the response. Surgery is typically done 8 weeks after the end of radiation.

---

If you or a family member have had an encounter with esophageal cancer surgery, I would love to hear about your experience, so please take a minute to leave a comment below. We're constantly creating new videos, so please subscribe to be notified of new videos when we post them.

I hope you have found this video helpful. This videos and others like it are designed to 

educate patients and families about esophageal cancer 

and equip them for their discussions with their esophageal cancer care team. 

As always, these videos are no substitute for expert medical advice.
